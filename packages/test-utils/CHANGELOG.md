# @stratum-hq/test-utils

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- b55ae70: Correct and complete package metadata for the npm registry listing.

  Every published package now declares `license` (MIT), `author`, `homepage`, and
  `bugs`. Runtime packages declare `engines` (Node >=20) to match the project's
  support policy; this fixes `@stratum-hq/cli`, which previously declared Node >=18.
  `@stratum-hq/mysql` and `@stratum-hq/mongodb` gain the `keywords` array they were
  missing. No runtime code changes.

- 4adcbb5: Stop shipping test files in published tarballs. tsc-built packages now exclude **tests** directories and .test/.spec files from compilation, so dist and the tarball contain only real package output. The create package, which ships source for its ./matrix export, excludes tests via .npmignore instead. The vitest runner is unaffected and still runs tests from src.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Security hardening release plus ecosystem polish: NestJS ALS context-leak fix, SSRF-safe webhook validation, production JWT/HKDF enforcement, fail-closed ORM adapters, SHA-pinned CI (#84); `create --preset` architecture with ORM-aware generators and Stack Wizard (#85); scaffolded projects now target Next 15 / React 19 / NestJS 11; MIT LICENSE and READMEs shipped in every package; dependency security bumps across the workspace.
