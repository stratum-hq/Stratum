# @stratum-hq/nestjs

## 1.0.0

### Patch Changes

- b55ae70: Correct and complete package metadata for the npm registry listing.

  Every published package now declares `license` (MIT), `author`, `homepage`, and
  `bugs`. Runtime packages declare `engines` (Node >=20) to match the project's
  support policy; this fixes `@stratum-hq/cli`, which previously declared Node >=18.
  `@stratum-hq/mysql` and `@stratum-hq/mongodb` gain the `keywords` array they were
  missing. No runtime code changes.

- 4adcbb5: Stop shipping test files in published tarballs. tsc-built packages now exclude **tests** directories and .test/.spec files from compilation, so dist and the tarball contain only real package output. The create package, which ships source for its ./matrix export, excludes tests via .npmignore instead. The vitest runner is unaffected and still runs tests from src.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 1a0b9b5: Make the verified JWT tenant authoritative in `StratumGuard`. Tenant resolution now runs JWT (verified) before the `X-Tenant-ID` header, so the header is only consulted as a fallback when no verified JWT tenant is present and can never override a verified identity. This aligns the guard's resolution order with the Express and Fastify middleware.
