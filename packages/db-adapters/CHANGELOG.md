# @stratum-hq/db-adapters

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- abc555d: Fix encryption key rotation to re-encrypt every sensitive row exactly once. Rotation now walks config entries and webhook secrets with a keyset cursor over the primary key, so datasets larger than a single batch are rotated fully and correctly instead of stalling after the first batch.

  Validate the tenant slug in `setSchemaSearchPath` before it is used to build the schema identifier, matching the other schema-isolation adapters. Identifiers outside the canonical slug charset are now rejected rather than interpolated into the search-path statement.

## 0.3.0

- Security hardening release plus ecosystem polish: NestJS ALS context-leak fix, SSRF-safe webhook validation, production JWT/HKDF enforcement, fail-closed ORM adapters, SHA-pinned CI (#84); `create --preset` architecture with ORM-aware generators and Stack Wizard (#85); scaffolded projects now target Next 15 / React 19 / NestJS 11; MIT LICENSE and READMEs shipped in every package; dependency security bumps across the workspace.
