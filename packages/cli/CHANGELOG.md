# @stratum-hq/cli

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- c17b1a5: Add an `exports` map to `@stratum-hq/control-plane` and `@stratum-hq/cli` so deep imports no longer resolve (#219, from the #133 v1.0 surface review).

  Neither package is a JS import surface: `@stratum-hq/control-plane` is a deployable server whose `index` calls `main()` on import (its 1.0 contract is the HTTP REST API and OpenAPI document), and `@stratum-hq/cli` is a bin whose contract is its command surface. Both now expose only their documented entry (`.`) and block accidental deep imports such as `@stratum-hq/control-plane/dist/routes/...`. The `stratum` bin and `node dist/index.js` startup are unchanged. If you deep-imported internals from either package (never a supported path), import from the package entry instead.

### Patch Changes

- b55ae70: Correct and complete package metadata for the npm registry listing.

  Every published package now declares `license` (MIT), `author`, `homepage`, and
  `bugs`. Runtime packages declare `engines` (Node >=20) to match the project's
  support policy; this fixes `@stratum-hq/cli`, which previously declared Node >=18.
  `@stratum-hq/mysql` and `@stratum-hq/mongodb` gain the `keywords` array they were
  missing. No runtime code changes.

- c17b1a5: Read the CLI `--version` string from `package.json` at runtime (#219, from the #133 v1.0 surface review).

  `stratum --version` hardcoded `v0.2.1` while the package was `0.3.0`, so the reported version lied. It now reads the real version from the installed `package.json`.

- c17b1a5: Give the `@stratum-hq/db-adapters` barrel one consistent naming scheme for the tenant-context helpers (#219, from the #133 v1.0 surface review).

  The barrel previously exposed the same "run in tenant context" concept under colliding names patched over with `as` aliases. The 1.0 names use an `<orm>` prefix so no export is an alias workaround:
  - `withTenant` (Prisma) -> `prismaWithTenant`
  - `withDrizzleTenant` -> `drizzleWithTenant`
  - `withTenantScope` (Sequelize) -> `sequelizeWithTenantScope`
  - `withDrizzleTenantScope` -> `drizzleWithTenantScope`
  - `enableRLSMigration` (migration helper) -> `enableRLSForMigration` (distinct from the runtime `enableRLS`)

  Behavior is identical; only the exported names change. The `@stratum-hq/cli` and `@stratum-hq/create` scaffolding templates emit the new `prismaWithTenant` name. Update your imports to the new names.
